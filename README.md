# 🎭 James Bland: ACME Edition

> *What happens when secret agents meet cartoon physics? Pure chaos.*

**James Bland: ACME Edition** transforms your living room into a spy thriller where exploding pianos, spring-loaded anvils, and jet-powered roller skates are standard issue equipment. This is espionage for the cartoon age—where every assassination attempt might end with an anvil to the head and every infiltration could be thwarted by a rubber duck patrol.

## 🎯 The Experience

Picture this: You and your friends, each armed with a phone, plotting against each other in real-time. Every 90 seconds, chaos erupts as everyone's schemes collide:

- **Sarah** tries to assassinate **Mike** with a piano drop, but **Mike's** bodyguard ducks deflect it
- **Alex** attempts to bug **Sarah's** safe house, only to trigger her booby-trapped forklift
- **Chris** broadcasts a fake banner from a biplane: *"MIKE IS THE TRAITOR!"*—but is anyone gullible enough to believe it?

All while cartoon sound effects fill the room and everyone's scheming for the next round.

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 Minutes to Mayhem)

1. **One person** runs the game server:
   ```bash
   git clone [this-repo]
   cd JamesBland
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python server.py
   ```

2. **Everyone else** opens their phone browser to: `http://[host-ip]:5000`

3. **Pick codenames**, hit start, and let the cartoon carnage begin!

*Works on any device with a browser—phones, tablets, laptops. No app store, no downloads, no hassle.*
