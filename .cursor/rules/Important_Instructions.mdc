# MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS
- Always refer to the [DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md](mdc:DEVELOPER_CHECKLIST.md) and other relevant docs before answering.
- Always keep [CONDENSED_CHECKLIST.md](mdc:CONDENSED_CHECKLIST.md) up to date by checking off the tasks you completed.
- Never add your own features without first consulting the user. (this is to avoid "feature creep")
